# Code book

1. Load and unzip the dataset: No variables used here

2. Reading activity and features data
•	activityLabels: stores activity labels data
•	features: stores features data

3. Extract only mean and standard deviation from features data
•	Featuresreq: stores all the feature index with mean and std dev in their associated names
•	featuresreq.names : stores all the feature names with mean and std dev in names

4. Load the training datasets
•	train: stores X_train.txt data
•	trainActivities:  stores Y_train.txt data
•	trainSubjects: stores subject_train data
•	train: Column binds train, trainActivities and trainSubjects

5. Load the test data sets
•	test: stores X_test.txt data
•	testActivities:  stores Y_test.txt data
•	testSubjects: stores subject_test data
•	test: Column binds test, testActivities and testSubjects

 6. Merge and add labels data 
•	consol_data: row binds train and test data

7. Fetching activity description from activity labels and ordering columns
•	consol_data_left: Left joined table with activity label to fetch activity description

8. Create independent tidy data set
•	consol_data_group: stores grouped data by subject and activity description and summarizes and calculates mean for other columns
